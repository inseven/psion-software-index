# Psion Software Index

Script for generating an index of a directory of EPOC32 SIS files

## Status

This code is at a very early proof-of-concept stage of discovery and development. My current thinking is that it could grow into something with a definition file listing known sources (Internet Archive, etc) of Psion software and generate a user friendly searchable index.
