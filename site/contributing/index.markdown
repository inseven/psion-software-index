# Contributing

Right now, we're looking for suggestions of Internet Archive items to include in the index, and for help generating screenshots, descriptions, and categorization for the items already the index. It's early days so processes for collection information are pretty unclear right now, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/jbmorley/psion-software-index/issues/new" target="_blank">raise a GitHub issue</a> with suggestions or peripheral material to be contributed, or simply <a href="mailto:support@jbmorley.co.uk">send an email</a>. And, if you have archives of Psion software and you're comfortable doing so, please consider contributing it to the <a href="https://archive.org/create/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>.
