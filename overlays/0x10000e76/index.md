Pipeline is an enjoyable puzzle game for one or two players. The point of the game is to lay down the Piping, connecting it together so that the Fuel can be piped through the level.

You can play through the 50 unique levels either One player or cooperatively Two player. You can also play head to head on one machine in the Two player Vs games in 10 challenging battlegrounds.

## Versions

Pipeline is available as two different versions:

- Low space version. Without Cutscenes - no intro, cutscenes between levels or ending.
- Fully animated version (check **PIPEHISI.ZIP** file below). The intriguing plot-line is developed by the fully animated cut-scenes throughout the game, this is the only EPOC32 program with cutscenes and high quality ones at that.
