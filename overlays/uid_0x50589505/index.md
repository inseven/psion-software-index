Colors is a clone of Simon for the Series 7 and netBook.

From the help file:

> The game is similar to the well known electronic game. Now it has been developed for the EPOC system as well.
>
> The principal is simple. The computer plays a series of colors, you have to repeat them without mistake.
>
> After each successful repetition, one color will be added. Time by time you will see that the game becomes more tricky.

While the game is pretty (and the color a novelty), it seems nearly impossible to play with tiles flashing too quickly to perceive, even on the slower Series 7.
