PsLight5 (pronounced 'Slight-Five') monitors the battery status every 5 seconds and will optionally report any drop in capacity from Good-Low-VeryLow-Zero (the thresholds are identical to the S5's built-in ones). This doesn't noticeably affect the speed of the Psion - I've successfully used the GPS moving map feature of RealMaps, whilst saving a logfile, tracing a route, and zooming in/out without dropping a single frame for an hours use even though PsLight5 was running. I have also written timing loops to test the processing time absorbed by PsLight5 and it appears to be about 0.6% on a classic series 5 - presumably it's even less on a 5mx.
