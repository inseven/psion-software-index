This application allows users to search for routes connecting two metro stations in Paris for Psion Series 5. (Psion Revo version [here](https://software.psion.info/programs/0x10000e7e/)

Stations can be entered in several ways:

- By typing part of the station name. For example, typing ORLE is enough to find PORTE D'ORLÉANS.

- By selecting a location directly on the map of the Paris region. The system will suggest the five stations closest to that spot.

- By typing part of a street name (or avenue, boulevard, square, cours, porte, etc.), followed by an asterisk. This tells the system to search in the street database rather than the station database. For example, SEBAS* will find BOULEVARD SÉBASTOPOL. If the street is near several stations, you’ll be asked to choose one.

The PREFERENCES menu lets you save a frequently used station. Then, when selecting a station, simply pressing ENTER will choose it automatically.
