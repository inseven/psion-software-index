> Biklog, written for the SERIES 3, SERIES 5 and Revo/Mako, is a small utility that will help bicyclist keep track of their bicycle rides and analyse their performance over a certain time. It started as an exercise on the programming capabitities of this neat machine. It grew to a more complete program in the 4 years of development, combining two of my hobbies bicycling and computing.
