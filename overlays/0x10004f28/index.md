If like me you tend to use a number of Databases on your S5, you'll find that you can often be in the wrong directory when you need to access your address book. FavDat5 is an Extras-Bar program that provides instant access to your FAVourite DATabase for the S5.
The first time you run the program you will be asked to locate your address file. Next time you click on the FavDat icon your addresses will be instantly available without having to track back to the right directory.
If you wish to change your favourite datafile then you will need to delete the \System\Apps\FavDat\FavDat5.INI file and start again.
